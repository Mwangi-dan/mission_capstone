# Flask App - Early Gastric Cancer Detection Model

This repository contains a Flask web application for early detection of gastric cancer using machine learning models. The app allows users to input medical data and receive predictions on the likelihood of early gastric cancer. It includes:

- A pre-trained machine learning model for cancer detection
- Flask-based web interface for user interaction
- Scripts for data preprocessing and model training
- Instructions for setting up and running the application

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for early diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.
